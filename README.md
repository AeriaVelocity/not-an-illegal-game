# Not An Illegal Game

Not An Illegal Game is a satirical puzzle/OS simulation game taking heavy
inspiration from (and poking fun at) certain classic 90s operating systems.

Not An Illegal Game will break the concepts of everything you know about digital
computing. You will use the system, you will not use the system. You will win
the game, you will not win the game. This software was not meant for you to
understand.

But as you explore, slowly, meaning begins to arise, the paradoxes might start
to make sense, perhaps you are powerful after all. The game is not here to fight
you; it is inviting you to dance.

(But rest assured, there's no Adventure Lineâ„¢.)

## Features

* **Classic 90s Accuracy** - At least five minutes was spent making Not An
  Illegal Game resemble those classic OSes as closely as is reasonably possible.

* **DOS-like Command Prompt** - You type a bunch of words, you hit Enter, and
  that makes it go! Just like the good old days, when typing the wrong thing
  means your computer is now screaming "Abort, Retry, Fail" at you!

* **To Error Is Illegal** - Be prepared for errors upon errors. Errors which are
  your responsibility, by the way. Enjoy the *authentic* 1990s computing
  experience!

* **Bind-Mending Puzzles** - These aren't your Core i5's puzzles. These puzzles
  are designed to be as aggravating as possible, so you'll never get bored!

* **"Helpful" AI Assistance** - Who says AI is a 2020s invention? Say hello to
  Clip-It, your virtual assistant! He'll help you write a letter, but not much
  else.

## System Requirements

* A Windows, Mac or Linux system that supports Godot 4.3

* A keyboard and mouse
