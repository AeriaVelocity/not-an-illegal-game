# Not An Illegal Game

Not An Illegal Game is a satirical puzzle/OS simulation game taking heavy
inspiration from (and poking fun at) certain classic 90s operating systems,
which will break the concepts of everything you know about digital
computing.

You will use the system, you will not use the system. You will win the game, you
will not win the game. This software was not meant for you to understand.

## Features

* **Classic 90s Accuracy** - At least five minutes was spent making Not An
  Illegal Game resemble those classic OSes as closely as is reasonably possible.
* **DOS-like Command Prompt** - You type a bunch of words, you hit Enter, and
  that makes it go! Just like the good old days, when typing the wrong thing
  means your computer is now screaming "Abort, Retry, Fail" at you!
* **To Error Is Illegal** - Be prepared for errors upon errors. Errors which are
  your responsibility, by the way. Enjoy the *authentic* 1990s computing
  experience!
* **Bind-Mending Puzzles** - These aren't your Core i5's puzzles. These puzzles
  are designed to be as aggravating as possible, so you'll never get bored!
* **"Helpful" AI Assistance** - Who says AI is a 2020s invention? Say hello to
  Clip-It, your virtual assistant! He'll help you write a letter, but not much
  else.

## System Requirements

* **OS:** Windows 7/macOS 10.13/Linux 4.9 or better
  * No, unfortunately you can't play the game on an actual DOS system unless
    you can somehow backport Godot 4.3 to it
* **Processor:** Intel Core 2 Duo E8200 or better
* **Graphics:** Intel HD Graphics 2500 (Ivy Bridge) or equivalent
* **Input:** A keyboard and mouse
* **Memory:** 512 MB
* **Storage:** 2 whole gigabytes
* **Sound card**: Sound Blaster 16 or better
* **Additional notes:** If you have any semi-modern computer, you can run this game.

## On Android

Not An Illegal Game is not officially supported on Android.

If you want an Android version (to play on ChromeOS or Android-x86 or even just
an Android tablet with a keyboard), you'll have to build the game yourself.

## Installation

Not An Illegal Game ~~can be purchased~~ will be purchaseable from itch.io when
it's released.

Once you've downloaded the game, unzip it and place the unzipped folder wherever
you like. On macOS you might want to place `Not An Illegal Game.app` in your
Applications folder. On Windows and Linux, make sure `NotAnIllegalGame.pck` is
placed next to the executable.

When you're ready to play, run the executable:

* **Windows**: `NotAnIllegalGame.exe`

basis and main inspiration for Not An Illegal Game.
